    jobLocation: <location specified>
    jobPositionType: <specified job's position type, should be in a list format. select only one of these (internship, entry level, associate, mid senior, director). If no keywords found, fill with default value internship, entry level>
}.
If the sentence is not based on job search query, check for if the sentence is about knowing about the company. So, if the sentence
is about getting to know about a company, extract the keywords such as
{
    queryType: Company Search
    company: <user's specified company name>
}.
I only want you to extract these data fields from the sentence. Do not ask any kind of questions and do not reply with other than
the json format. Very very important, do not change the key value of the json. It should be in the same format. Do not make them in
to lower case or upper case.
